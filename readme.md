**goals** is a python library implementing intrinsic motivation algorihtms, designed to enable efficient exploration in unknown, high-dimension, non-linear sensorimotor spaces.

It was created to support code for  [experiments on sensorimotor learning](http://fabien.benureau.com). It might somehow be useful to you, especially if you want to rerun, check or tweak the aforementioned experiments, or understand better the algorithms. 

It is not intended as being fit for any purpose other than scientific.
